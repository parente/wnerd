    <h1><a name="about"></a>About</h1>
    <p>Wrestling Nerd is designed to help manage wrestling tournaments. It features a simple point and click interface for advancing wrestlers in a tournament. Scores are automatically calculated based on win types as the tournament progresses. The program prints brackets, bouts, scores, and place winners. It also performs a number of queries like fastest fall times, the number of bouts, and individual wrestler statistics.</p>

    <p>Wrestling Nerd is Open Source Software. Program binaries and source code can be downloaded and used according to the terms of the <a href="license.html">MIT License</a>.</p>

    <h3>1/1/11</h3>
    <p>I've moved the Wrestling Nerd homepage to my own personal domain from SourceForge and the code to GitHub where my other projects reside. You can still download Wrestling Nerd for free as always using the link below.</p>
    <p>I've also started a Wrestling Nerd Google Group you can join to ask questions of myself and other WNerd users. Please join to ask your questions and post ideas so others can benefit from the discussion.</p>
    
    <p>I am considering writing a new, paperless and wireless version of the software that can run on Windows, Mac, or Linux right in your web browser without an Internet connection during the tourney. Please post to the Google Group if you have an interest in such an update.</p>
