    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
    <h2><a name="what"></a>What is Wrestling Nerd?</h2>
    <p>Wrestling Nerd is computer software that assists in the management of wrestling tournaments.
    A user enters information like wrestler names, team names, and match results on a bracket on
    the screen. The software, in turn, automatically calculates team scores; determines fast fall
    leaders; prints bouts, brackets, scores, and place winners; exports results to common formats;
    and more. In effect, Wrestling Nerd tries to reduce some of the burden a person must shoulder to
    successfully run a large tournament.</p>
