    <h1><a name="about"></a>About</h1>
    <p>Wrestling Nerd is designed to help manage wrestling tournaments. It features a simple point
    and click interface for advancing wrestlers in a tournament. Scores are automatically calculated
    based on win types as the tournament progresses. The program prints brackets, bouts, scores,
    and place winners. It also performs a number of queries like fastest fall times, the number of
    bouts, and individual wrestler statistics.</p>

    <p>Wrestling Nerd is Open Source Software. Program binaries and source code can be downloaded
    and used according to the terms of the <a href="license.html">license</a>.</p>

    <h3>12/12/04</h3>
    <p>Wrestling Nerd 3.2 is now available for download. See the post from 12/9 below for a list of improvements. I've
    updated the <a href="#doc">documentation</a> to describe the new features since version 3.0, but I still have to
    finish the section on how to create new bracket layouts.</p>

    <h3>12/9/04</h3>
    <p>It's been quite a long time since I've posted an update. Now that the fall semester is almost over, I have some
    time to make improvements to WN. I should have a new release posted here in a few days that includes the following:
      <ul>
        <li>The ability to rename a tournament while running it</li>
        <li>A confirmation dialog that asks if you'd like to save your work before quitting</li>
        <li>A fix for the score printing bug</li>
        <li>Print previews</li>
        <li>User-designed tournament layouts</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>I'm not sure if I'll have time to fill in the documentation about creating your own tournament layouts, but I'll
    include an early version of that feature in the next release if someone wants to fool with it.</p>

    <h3>2/16/04</h3>
    <p>Wrestling Nerd 3.1.1 has been released. Crossbracketing has been changed so that it occurs in
    the quarters instead of the semis for the CT State Championship and CT State Open tournaments.
    </p>
